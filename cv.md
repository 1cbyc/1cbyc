## üë®‚Äçüíª About Me

I'm a full stack developer with up to eleven years freelance experience in web development and seven years' experience building smart contracts. I started building websites in 2014 with WordPress, then went on to start building with PHP which has, in fact, become my gateway to every other skill I learnt over time. I got into blockchain in 2017, and once I got a hang of the space, I learnt to write solidity and typescript. Ever since, I have been involved in the development of more than 100 websites (either as the sole developer, or a member of the development team) and built a little over 17 live smart contracts. Additionally, I have about eight years of experience in offensive security, successfully delivering 126+ freelance projects spanning smart contracts, websites, bots, automation and safety-critical software. I also have serious interest in AI/ML, and quantitative development with a proven track record of leading a technical team and working with other developers.
