Hi! I'm Isaac, and I have spent the last 11 years building over 237 websites, smart contracts and information security tools for people doing things I find interesting. I recently started a new combined degree in mathematics and computer science (my third degree, in fact) with hopes of becoming a 10x math guy while doing new things.

I also made a decision to create and maintain my own [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@1cbyc) this year, 2025 to document what i'm building in my spare time, and how far my curiosity has lead me as a programmer. Currently, I've decided to master programming Java this year, as I navigate the waters of quantitative finance and I am excited to show what I'm doing.

That said, since I have spent a little over a decade as a fullstack developer, I should also show some of the projects I worked on that I found interesting too:

As much as I use [Twitter](https://x.com/1cbyc) alot, I prefer people reaching out to me via **email** on [ei@nsisong.com](mailto:ei@nsisong.com). Although you can check my [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/isaacnsisong) if you feel like it.
