# 👋 Hello, I'm Emmanuel Isaac, and these days, I spend more time building safety-critical software and automating day-to-day processes with code. I'm passionate about areas like blockchain, offensive security, safety-critical engineering (especially in healthcare), and open-source software.

**Software Engineer | Security Researcher**     ![](https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=1cbyc&color=blueviolet)

---

😹 Someone calls me 'Dad'. Another calls me 'Daddy'. Others call me 'Boss'. I'm passionate about building software that solves real-world problems.

## 🔍 What I Do?
- **Full-Stack Development**: I design and build robust web applications. Previously, I built [p2pfi.co](https://alpha.p2pfi.co), a self-custodial crypto marketplace, with my brother.
- **Safety-Critical Systems**: I develop software for safety-critical applications in both **healthcare** and **aviation**, ensuring that these systems are reliable, secure, and meet stringent regulatory standards.
- **Offensive Security**: With my experience in identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities, I've helped some startups (and government agencies) secure their systems before attackers could. This led me to start [Nidful](https://nidful.com), a platform connecting Nigerian businesses with ethical hackers to identify and fix security vulnerabilities through bug bounty programs and vulnerability disclosure.
- **Financial Engineering**: I have this passing interest in financial systems and algorithmic trading, I leverage my technical skills to explore and innovate within this domain.

## 🌱 Learning & Growth
- After moving from a degree in Pasture and Range Management, I completed my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. I am now pursuing a second degree in **Mathematics and Computer Science** to master areas like Fourier series, Laplace transforms, and their applications in engineering and finance.
- I am continuously trying to enhance my communication skills to better share my ideas and collaborate effectively.
