👋 Hi there,
## I’m Isaac Emmanuel (@1cbyc) ![](https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=1cbyc&color=blueviolet)

  😹 Someone calls me 'Dad'. Another calls me 'Daddy'. Others call me 'Boss'.<br>
  🌱 I’m currently learning to be great at communicating with people.<br>
  👀 I’m interested in information security and financial engineering.<br>
  🖥 I built [p2pfi.co](https://alpha.p2pfi.co) (a self-custodial crypto marketplace) with my kid bro and a few others about three years ago, before i discontinued due to regulations.<br>
  🖥 I'm now building [nidful.com](https://nidful.com), a cybersecurity platform connecting nigerian businesses with ethical hackers to identify and fix security vulnerabilities through bug bounty programs and vulnerability disclosure.<br>
  💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on all kinds of offensive security, financial engineering and web development tasks with businesses and government entities.<br>
  🔭 I also decided to pursure a second degree in Mathematics and Computer Science to satisfy my obsession with fourier series and laplace.<br>
  🥋 Ask me about PHP, Erlang, Ada, Lisp, C/C++, C#, Java, Python and Typescript (probably, Golang soon enough - i don't even find Go interesting though)<br>
  📫 Reach me via [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/isaacnsisong) or [Email](mailto:ei@nsisong.com)<br>
  🥋 If I wanted a fulltime role, I'm certain I'd perform exceptionally in any of the following roles (at midlevel to senior level): Fullstack Developer, Backend Developer, Blockchain Developer, DevOps Engineer, Systems Programmer, Safety-Critical Software Engineer, and/or Quant Developer<br>
  👀 I even used to maintain a [blog](https://ei.nsisong.com) but recently, i now solve problems on [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/u/1cbyc/)
