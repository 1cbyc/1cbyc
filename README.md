#### üëã I'm EMMANUEL Isaac, and over the last decade, I've spent more time studying and building websites, developing smart contracts, creating healthcare software, and designing systems for quantitative trading. Out of curiosity, I decided to enroll for another degree in mathematics. It's been a wonderful decade being a fullstack web developer, time to focus on doing more as a quant developer.
