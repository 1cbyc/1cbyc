😹 Someone calls me 'Dad.' Another calls me 'Daddy.' Others call me 'Boss.' But what truly drives me is building software that solves real-world problems.

## 🔍 What I Do?
- **Full-Stack Development**: I design and build robust web applications. Previously, I built [p2pfi.co](https://alpha.p2pfi.co), a self-custodial crypto marketplace, with my brother.
- **Safety-Critical Systems**: I develop software for safety-critical applications in **healthcare** and **aviation**, ensuring reliability, security, and compliance with strict regulatory standards.
- **Offensive Security**: With a knack for identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities, I've helped startups and government agencies secure their systems. This led me to start [Nidful](https://nidful.com), a platform connecting Nigerian businesses with ethical hackers for bug bounties and vulnerability disclosure.
- **Financial Engineering**: My passion for financial systems and algorithmic trading drives me to explore and innovate in this domain, leveraging my technical skills.

## 🌱 Learning & Growth
- After moving from Pasture and Range Management, I earned my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and am now pursuing a second degree in **Mathematics and Computer Science**. I am mastering **Fourier series**, **Laplace transforms**, and their applications in engineering and finance.
- I'm continuously enhancing my communication skills to better share ideas and collaborate effectively.
