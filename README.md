# ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Emmanuel Isaac

These days, I focus on building **safety-critical software** and **automating day-to-day processes** with code. I enjoy doing things involving the **blockchain**, **offensive security**, **safety-critical engineering** (especially in healthcare), and **open-source software**.
