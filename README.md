Hi! I'm Isaac, and I have spent the last 11 years building over 237 websites, smart contracts and information security tools for people doing things I find interesting. I recently started a new combined degree in mathematics and computer science (my third degree, in fact) with hopes of becoming a 10x math guy while doing new things.

I also made a decision to create and maintain my own [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@1cbyc) this year, 2025 to document what i'm building in my spare time, and how far my curiosity has lead me as a programmer. Currently, I've decided to master programming Java this year, as I navigate the waters of quantitative finance and I am excited to show what I'm doing.

That said, since I have spent a little over a decade as a fullstack developer, I should also show some of the projects I worked on that I found interesting too:
- Smart Contract Vulnerability Scanner [check cource](https://github.com/1cbyc/secure-audit) / [view live](https://secure-audit.nsisonglabs.xyz) `typescript`
- Nigerian Bank ATM Simulator [Bank ATM Simulator](https://github.com/1cbyc/atm_simulation) `java`
- Custom Web Scraper [check source](https://github.com/1cbyc/1cbyc-web-scraper) / [view live](https://webscraper.nsisonglabs.xyz) `python` `vue`
- Pneumonia Image Identifier [check source](https://github.com/1cbyc/image_classification) / [view live](https://pneumonia-detection.nsisonglabs.xyz/) `python` `react` `kaggle`
- DSA Solutions `for Leetcode` [check solutions](https://github.com/1cbyc/leetcode) `c++` `python` `java` `php`
- Custom Stock Trading Bot [check source](https://github.com/1cbyc/1cbyc-trading-bot)
- Decentralized Cryptocurrency Marketplace [view site](https://p2pfi.co/)  / `smart contract development` `java/php` `api development
- EVM Auto Transfer Bot [view source](https://github.com/1cbyc/EVM-AutoTransfer-Bot)
- NidFul [view project](https://nidful.com/) / `java/php` `api development`
- Laboratory Result Automation System for InterSwitch eClinic
- Emem Network Analyzer [check source](https://github.com/1cbyc/emem_network_analyzer) / [view live]()

As much as I use [Twitter](https://x.com/1cbyc) alot, I prefer people reaching out to me via **email** on [ei@nsisong.com](mailto:ei@nsisong.com). Although you can check my [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/isaacnsisong) if you feel like it.

## üíñ ok, cheers
I dedicate this GitHub to the woman of my dreams. I love you so much! ‚ù§Ô∏èüåπ
