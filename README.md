👋 Hi,
## I’m Isaac Emmanuel (@1cbyc) ![](https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=1cbyc&color=blueviolet)

  😹 Someone calls me 'Dad'. Another calls me 'Daddy'. Others call me 'Boss'. <br>
  🌱 I’m currently learning to be great at communicating with people.<br>
  👀 I’m interested in information security, blockchain and financial services.<br>
  🖥 I built [p2pfi.co](https://alpha.p2pfi.co) (a self-custodial crypto marketplace) with my kid bro and a few others.<br>
  🖥 I'm building [nidful.com](https://nidful.com) (a bug bounty platform for Nigerians) to satisfy my ego.<br>
  💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on all kinds of offensive security, blockchain and web development tasks with startups and government entities.<br>
  🔭 I contribute weekly to opensource projects (Well, so far I've been consistent contributing to projects written in PHP, Javascript, C# and Rust) <br>
  🥋 Ask me about PHP, Erlang, Java & C# (prolly Rust, Golang soon enough)<br>
  📫 Reach me via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/1cbyc), [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/isaacnsisong) or [Email](mailto:ei@nsisong.com) <br>
  🥋 If I wanted a Fulltime role, I'm certain I'd perform in the following roles: Fullstack Developer, Backend Developer, Blockchain Developer, DevOps Engineer, Systems Programmer & Technical Lead Architect<br>

 <!-- 👀 I even have a blog, see https://theirdaddy.com  -->
