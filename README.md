  🖥 I'm now building [nidful.com](https://nidful.com), a cybersecurity platform connecting nigerian businesses with ethical hackers to identify and fix security vulnerabilities through bug bounty programs and vulnerability disclosure.<br>
  💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on all kinds of offensive security, financial engineering and web development tasks with businesses and government entities.<br>
  🔭 I also decided to pursure a second degree in Mathematics and Computer Science to satisfy my obsession with fourier series and laplace.<br>
